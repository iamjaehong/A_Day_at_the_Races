A_Day_at_the_Races
==================

Head First C# (third edition), C# Lab - A Day at the Races 

This is my solution of the Head First C# Lab - A Day at the Races.
Readers of this book may like my solution because it uses only fragments 
and intelligence covered in the chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4. No additional .NET
components have been used to complete this project.
